But the good part is you get to decide how you\u0027re going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they\u0027ll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they\u0027re your true best friends. Don\u0027t let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they\u0027ll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can\u0027t give up because if you give up, you\u0027ll never find your soulmate. You\u0027ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don\u0027t, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life\u0027s a beautiful thing and there\u0027s so much to smile about.",

She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don\u0027t hurt her, don\u0027t change her, don\u0027t analyze and don\u0027t expect more than she can give.
